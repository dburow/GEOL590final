# GEOL590final
R code and data for GEOL 590 final project

These files are rasters representing changes in coastal NC red reflectance following Hurricane Florence.

The composite tif represents changes in red reflectance derived from two MODIS eight-day composite images (08 to 16 Oct minus 22 Sep to 30 Sep).
The single day tif represents changes in red reflectance derived from two MODIS single day images (13 Oct minus 27 Sep) that were relatively cloud free. 

The r code files create 1) histograms from these tiffs, and 2) empirical semivariograms from these tiffs.
